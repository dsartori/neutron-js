# Neutron.js

Neutron.js is a JavaScript port of an Objective-C implementation of the abstract game "Neutron." The game features an asymmetric board setup, where the goal is to move the neutron piece to the opponent's home row while strategically positioning your pieces to block the opponent's neutron. 

## About the Original Game

The original rules of Neutron were published in *Games & Puzzles* magazine by Robert Kraus in 1978. The game features a 5x5 board and involves two players, one controlling white pieces and the other controlling black. The aim is to move the neutron to the opponent's back row or to block all possible moves of the opponentâ€™s neutron. The game is remarkable due to its easy-to-learn rules and complex strategy.

## About the Port

This project is a JavaScript port of the iOS version of Neutron, which was released by Doug Sartori in January 2011. The iOS version was a faithful implementation of the game and was downloaded thousands of times before it was eventually delisted from the App Store.
